149	Because Eight Legged Freaks is partly an homage to Them , Tarantula and other low - budget B-movie thrillers of the 1950s and '60s , the movie is a silly -LRB- but not sophomoric -RRB- romp through horror and hellish conditions .	2
150	It feels like very light Errol Morris , focusing on eccentricity but failing , ultimately , to make something bigger out of its scrapbook of oddballs .	1
151	Spielberg 's realization of a near-future America is masterful .	4

164	You bet there is and it 's what makes this rather convoluted journey worth taking .	2

180	An awkwardly contrived exercise in magic realism .	1

182	Like Smoke Signals , the film is also imbued with strong themes of familial ties and spirituality that are powerful and moving without stooping to base melodrama	3
183	Evokes the style and flash of the double-cross that made Mamet 's `` House of Games '' and last fall 's `` Heist '' so much fun .	3
184	The film aims to be funny , uplifting and moving , sometimes all at once .	3
185	At a brief 42 minutes , we need more X and less blab .	2

216	Would 've been nice if the screenwriters had trusted audiences to understand a complex story , and left off the film 's predictable denouement .	0
217	A superfluous sequel ... plagued by that old familiar feeling of ` let 's get this thing over with ' : Everyone has shown up at the appointed time and place , but visible enthusiasm is mighty hard to find .	1

254	Some of the computer animation is handsome , and various amusing sidekicks add much-needed levity to the otherwise bleak tale , but overall the film never rises above mediocrity .	1
255	Offers the flash of rock videos fused with solid performances and eerie atmosphere .	4
256	A breezy blend of art , history , esoteric musings and philosophy .	3
257	Now as a former Gong Show addict , I 'll admit it , my only complaint is that we did n't get more re-creations of all those famous moments from the show .	3
258	Genuinely unnerving .	3
259	The increasingly diverse French director has created a film that one can honestly describe as looking , sounding and simply feeling like no other film in recent history .	4
260	One of those joyous films that leaps over national boundaries and celebrates universal human nature .	3
261	A difficult but worthy film that bites off more than it can chew by linking the massacre of Armenians in 1915 with some difficult relationships in the present .	2
262	Halfway through the movie , the humor dwindles .	1
263	Witty and often surprising , a dark little morality tale disguised as a romantic comedy .	4
264	One senses in World Traveler and in his earlier film that Freundlich bears a grievous but obscure complaint against fathers , and circles it obsessively , without making contact .	1
265	In fact , even better .	3
266	... a preachy parable stylized with a touch of John Woo bullet ballet .	2
267	Proves that some movie formulas do n't need messing with -- like the big-bug movie .	2
268	An uplifting , largely bogus story .	2
269	Thanks to confident filmmaking and a pair of fascinating performances , the way to that destination is a really special walk in the woods .	4
270	Superbly photographed and staged by Mendes with a series of riveting set pieces the likes of which mainstream audiences have rarely seen .	4
271	A mesmerizing cinematic poem from the first frame to the last .	4
272	After the first 10 minutes , which is worth seeing	3
273	It has become apparent that the franchise 's best years are long past .	1
274	Screenwriter Chris ver Weil 's directing debut is good-natured and never dull , but its virtues are small and easily overshadowed by its predictability .	2
275	Too much of Storytelling moves away from Solondz 's social critique , casting its audience as that of intellectual lector in contemplation of the auteur 's professional injuries .	1
276	Ultimately , Sarah 's dedication to finding her husband seems more psychotic than romantic , and nothing in the movie makes a convincing case that one woman 's broken heart outweighs all the loss we witness .	1
277	The jokes are flat , and the action looks fake .	0
278	A mildly enjoyable if toothless adaptation of a much better book .	2
279	Festers in just such a dungpile that you 'd swear you were watching monkeys flinging their feces at you .	0
280	In addition to the overcooked , ham-fisted direction , which has all the actors reaching for the back row , the dialogue sounds like horrible poetry .	0
281	A vile , incoherent mess ... a scummy ripoff of David Cronenberg 's brilliant ` Videodrome . '	0
282	First , for a movie that tries to be smart , it 's kinda dumb .	1
283	I was sent a copyof this film to review on DVD .	2
284	... silly humbuggery ...	1

286	A smart , arch and rather cold-blooded comedy .	3

288	Its flame-like , roiling black-and-white inspires trembling and gratitude .	3
289	Robinson 's web of suspense matches the page-turning frenzy that Clancy creates .	4
290	A slight but sweet film .	3
291	Got a David Lynch jones ?	2
292	Earnest and tentative even when it aims to shock .	2
293	Time of Favor could have given audiences the time of day by concentrating on the elements of a revealing alienation among a culture of people who sadly are at hostile odds with one another through recklessness and retaliation .	1
294	`` Austin Powers in Goldmember '' has the right stuff for silly summer entertainment and has enough laughs to sustain interest to the end .	4
295	What puzzles me is the lack of emphasis on music in Britney Spears ' first movie .	2
296	The filmmakers might want to look it up .	2
297	While maintaining the appearance of clinical objectivity , this sad , occasionally horrifying but often inspiring film is among Wiseman 's warmest .	4
298	There is simply no doubt that this film asks the right questions at the right time in the history of our country .	4
299	A dreary movie .	0
300	Sadly , though many of the actors throw off a spark or two when they first appear , they ca n't generate enough heat in this cold vacuum of a comedy to start a reaction .	1
301	To the filmmakers , Ivan is a prince of a fellow , but he comes across as shallow and glib though not mean-spirited , and there 's no indication that he 's been responsible for putting together any movies of particular value or merit .	1
302	Using a stock plot , About a Boy injects just enough freshness into the proceedings to provide an enjoyable 100 minutes in a movie theater .	3
303	Beating the Austin Powers films at their own game , this blaxploitation spoof downplays the raunch in favor of gags that rely on the strength of their own cleverness as opposed to the extent of their outrageousness .	3
304	What begins as a conventional thriller evolves into a gorgeously atmospheric meditation on life-changing chance encounters .	3
305	Buy popcorn .	2
306	A late-night cable sexploitation romp masquerading as a thriller about the ruthless social order that governs college cliques .	2
307	A well-intentioned effort that 's still too burdened by the actor 's offbeat sensibilities for the earnest emotional core to emerge with any degree of accessibility .	1
308	-LRB- Allen 's -RRB- been making piffle for a long while , and Hollywood Ending may be his way of saying that piffle is all that the airhead movie business deserves from him right now .	2
309	Seeing as the film lacks momentum and its position remains mostly undeterminable , the director 's experiment is a successful one .	3
310	Judith and Zaza 's extended bedroom sequence ... is so intimate and sensual and funny and psychologically self-revealing that it makes most of what passes for sex in the movies look like cheap hysterics .	4
311	Uneven performances and a spotty script add up to a biting satire that has no teeth .	1
312	... irritating soul-searching garbage .	0
313	A solid , spooky entertainment worthy of the price of a ticket .	3
314	Ultimately , clarity matters , both in breaking codes and making movies .	2
315	In comparison to his earlier films it seems a disappointingly thin slice of lower-class London life ; despite the title ... amounts to surprisingly little .	0
316	Proves mainly that South Korean filmmakers can make undemanding action movies with all the alacrity of their Hollywood counterparts .	2
317	Except it 's much , much better .	4
318	It is a happy , heady jumble of thought and storytelling , an insane comic undertaking that ultimately coheres into a sane and breathtakingly creative film .	4
319	There is more than one joke about putting the toilet seat down .	2
320	has -RRB-	2
321	So original in its base concept that you can not help but get caught up .	4
322	It appears to have been made by people to whom the idea of narrative logic or cohesion is an entirely foreign concept .	0
323	If you ignore the cliches and concentrate on City by the Sea 's interpersonal drama , it ai n't half-bad .	2
324	A dreadful day in Irish history is given passionate , if somewhat flawed , treatment .	3
325	See it .	4
326	Nothing but an episode of Smackdown !	1
327	A guilty pleasure at best , and not worth seeing unless you want to laugh at it .	2
328	Perhaps a better celebration of these unfairly dismissed heroes would be a film that is n't this painfully forced , false and fabricated .	1
329	A relative letdown .	0
330	` Hey Arnold ! '	2
331	But though he only scratches the surface , at least he provides a strong itch to explore more .	3
332	The band performances featured in Drumline are red hot ... -LRB- but -RRB- from a mere story point of view , the film 's ice cold .	2
333	A non-mystery mystery .	1
334	Leigh is one of the rare directors who feels acting is the heart and soul of cinema .	4
335	The cast delivers without sham the raw-nerved story .	3
336	This is a monumental achievement in practically every facet of inept filmmaking : joyless , idiotic , annoying , heavy-handed , visually atrocious , and often downright creepy .	1
337	The filmmaker 's heart is in the right place ...	2
338	One of the most highly-praised disappointments I 've had the misfortune to watch in quite some time .	0
339	Rock 's stand-up magic wanes .	1
340	Roman Polanski directs The Pianist like a surgeon mends a broken heart ; very meticulously but without any passion .	1
341	Sadly , ` Garth ' has n't progressed as nicely as ` Wayne . '	1
342	With wit and empathy to spare , waydowntown acknowledges the silent screams of workaday inertia but stops short of indulging its characters ' striving solipsism .	2
343	It labours as storytelling .	1
344	Remember back when thrillers actually thrilled ?	1
345	The otherwise good-naturedness of Mr. Deeds , with its embrace of sheer goofiness and cameos of less - than-likely New York celebrities ... certainly raises the film above anything Sandler 's been attached to before .	3
346	Fails so fundamentally on every conventional level that it achieves some kind of goofy grandeur .	1
347	... a ho-hum affair , always watchable yet hardly memorable .	2
348	I just saw this movie ... well , it 's probably not accurate to call it a movie .	1
349	Though uniformly well acted , especially by young Ballesta and Galan -LRB- a first-time actor -RRB- , writer\/director Achero Manas 's film is schematic and obvious .	2
350	When you resurrect a dead man , Hard Copy should come a-knocking , no ?	2
351	If the idea of the white man arriving on foreign shores to show wary natives the true light is abhorrent to you , the simplistic Heaven will quite likely be more like hell .	2
352	It 's hard to believe that a relationship like Holly and Marina 's could survive the hothouse emotions of teendom , and its longevity gets more inexplicable as the characterizations turn more crassly reductive .	2
353	For a movie audience , The Hours does n't connect in a neat way , but introduces characters who illuminate mysteries of sex , duty and love .	2
354	Purports to be a Hollywood satire but winds up as the kind of film that should be the target of something deeper and more engaging .	1
355	Too clever by about nine-tenths .	3
356	This is no `` Waterboy ! ''	1
357	They 're going through the motions , but the zip is gone .	2
358	The script 's snazzy dialogue establishes a realistic atmosphere that involves us in the unfolding crisis , but the lazy plotting ensures that little of our emotional investment pays off .	2
359	Not as good as the original , but what is ...	2
360	Those moviegoers who would automatically bypass a hip-hop documentary should give `` Scratch '' a second look .	4
361	Bigelow offers some flashy twists and turns that occasionally fortify this turgid fable .	3
362	An unsophisticated sci-fi drama that takes itself all too seriously .	1
363	Stupid , infantile , redundant , sloppy , over-the-top , and amateurish .	0
364	Resident Evil is what comes from taking John Carpenter 's Ghosts of Mars and eliminating the beheadings .	2
365	The movie resolutely avoids all the comic possibilities of its situation , and becomes one more dumb high school comedy about sex gags and prom dates .	0
366	With or without the sex , a wonderful tale of love and destiny , told well by a master storyteller	4
367	Though it goes further than both , anyone who has seen The Hunger or Cat People will find little new here , but a tasty performance from Vincent Gallo lifts this tale of cannibal lust above the ordinary .	3
368	A terrific date movie , whatever your orientation .	3
369	Once the expectation of laughter has been quashed by whatever obscenity is at hand , even the funniest idea is n't funny .	0
370	How do you make a movie with depth about a man who lacked any ?	1
371	Translation : ` We do n't need to try very hard . '	1
372	`` Frailty '' offers chills much like those that you get when sitting around a campfire around midnight , telling creepy stories to give each other the willies .	4
373	Less front-loaded and more shapely than the two-hour version released here in 1990 .	2
374	An ambitious movie that , like Shiner 's organizing of the big fight , pulls off enough of its effects to make up for the ones that do n't come off .	4
375	Some movies suck you in despite their flaws , and Heaven is one such beast .	4
376	Very well written and directed with brutal honesty and respect for its audience .	4
377	Twenty years after its first release , E.T. remains the most wondrous of all Hollywood fantasies -- and the apex of Steven Spielberg 's misunderstood career .	4
378	Gooding offers a desperately ingratiating performance .	1
379	... stumbles over every cheap trick in the book trying to make the outrage come even easier .	1
380	Nicely combines the enigmatic features of ` Memento ' with the hallucinatory drug culture of ` Requiem for a Dream . '	3
381	Every individual will see the movie through the prism of his or her own beliefs and prejudices , but the one thing most will take away is the sense that peace is possible .	4
382	Just a bunch of good actors flailing around in a caper that 's neither original nor terribly funny .	0
383	This ill-conceived and expensive project winds up looking like a bunch of talented thesps slumming it .	0
384	Broder 's screenplay is shallow , offensive and redundant , with pitifully few real laughs .	1
385	Leguizamo and Jones are both excellent and the rest of the cast is uniformly superb .	4
386	Trying to figure out the rules of the Country Bear universe -- when are bears bears and when are they like humans , only hairier -- would tax Einstein 's brain .	1
387	`` Feardotcom '' has the makings of an interesting meditation on the ethereal nature of the internet and the otherworldly energies it could channel , but it simply becomes a routine shocker .	2
388	Delia , Greta , and Paula rank as three of the most multilayered and sympathetic female characters of the year .	4
389	The beauty of Alexander Payne 's ode to the Everyman is in the details .	3
390	The town has kind of an authentic feel , but each one of these people stand out and everybody else is in the background and it just seems manufactured to me and artificial .	1
391	Julie Davis is the Kathie Lee Gifford of film directors , sadly proving once again ego does n't always go hand in hand with talent .	1
392	Much credit must be given to the water-camera operating team of Don King , Sonny Miller , and Michael Stewart .	3
393	In this film , Aussie David Caesar channels the not-quite-dead career of Guy Ritchie .	2
394	As averse as I usually am to feel-good , follow-your-dream Hollywood fantasies , this one got to me .	4
395	Maybe it is formula filmmaking , but there 's nothing wrong with that if the film is well-crafted and this one is .	3
396	Would you laugh if a tuba-playing dwarf rolled down a hill in a trash can ?	2
397	Loses its sense of humor in a vat of failed jokes , twitchy acting , and general boorishness .	0
398	This misty-eyed Southern nostalgia piece , in treading the line between sappy and sanguine , winds up mired in tear-drenched quicksand .	1
399	To be oblivious to the existence of this film would be very sweet indeed .	1
400	Despite its flaws ... Belinsky is still able to create an engaging story that keeps you guessing at almost every turn .	3
401	A porn film without the sex scenes .	2
402	The movie plays up the cartoon 's more obvious strength of snazziness while neglecting its less conspicuous writing strength .	2
403	Notwithstanding my problem with the movie 's final half hour , I 'm going to recommend SECRETARY , based on the wonderful acting clinic put on by Spader and Gyllenhaal , and also the unique way Shainberg goes about telling what at heart is a sweet little girl -	3
404	Despite slick production values and director Roger Michell 's tick-tock pacing , the final effect is like having two guys yelling in your face for two hours .	1
405	`` Barbershop '' is a good-hearted ensemble comedy with a variety of quirky characters and an engaging story .	3
406	A soulless jumble of ineptly assembled cliches and pabulum that plays like a 95-minute commercial for NBA properties .	1
407	An ambitious , serious film that manages to do virtually everything wrong ; sitting through it is something akin to an act of cinematic penance .	2
408	Consistently clever and suspenseful .	4
409	Soderbergh skims the fat from the 1972 film .	3
410	Hilarious musical comedy though stymied by accents thick as mud .	2
411	A movie like The Guys is why film criticism can be considered work .	1
412	Anyone who suffers through this film deserves , at the very least , a big box of consolation candy .	0
413	Bearable .	2
414	Cremaster 3 is at once a tough pill to swallow and a minor miracle of self-expression .	3
415	But Kouyate elicits strong performances from his cast , and he delivers a powerful commentary on how governments lie , no matter who runs them .	3
416	See it for his performance if nothing else .	3
417	The asylum material is gripping , as are the scenes of Jia with his family .	4
418	I walked away from this new version of E.T. just as I hoped I would -- with moist eyes .	4
419	Attal pushes too hard to make this a comedy or serious drama .	0
420	plays like some corny television production from a bygone era	1
421	It 's a powerful though flawed movie , guaranteed to put a lump in your throat while reaffirming Washington as possibly the best actor working in movies today .	4
422	Solondz may well be the only one laughing at his own joke	1
423	Here 's a case of two actors who do everything humanly possible to create characters who are sweet and believable , and are defeated by a screenplay that forces them into bizarre , implausible behavior .	1
424	Any enjoyment will be hinge from a personal threshold of watching sad but endearing characters do extremely unconventional things .	3
425	Some Body smacks of exhibitionism more than it does cathartic truth telling .	1
426	Though writer\/director Bart Freundlich 's film ultimately becomes a simplistic story about a dysfunctional parent-child relationship , it has some special qualities and the soulful gravity of Crudup 's anchoring performance .	3
427	-LRB- Carvey 's -RRB- characters are both overplayed and exaggerated , but then again , subtlety has never been his trademark .	0
428	This beautifully animated epic is never dull .	4
429	Charming and witty , it 's also somewhat clumsy .	3
430	In one scene , we get a stab at soccer hooliganism , a double-barreled rip-off of Quentin Tarantino 's climactic shootout -- and Meat Loaf explodes .	1
431	frustratingly refuses to give Pinochet 's crimes a political context	0
432	Paul Bettany playing Malcolm McDowell ?	2
433	A serviceable Euro-trash action extravaganza , with a decent sense of humor and plenty of things that go boom -- handguns , BMWs and seaside chateaus .	2
434	Veterans of the dating wars will smirk uneasily at the film 's nightmare versions of everyday sex-in-the-city misadventures .	2
435	It sends you away a believer again and quite cheered at just that .	4
436	The rollerball sequences feel sanitised and stagey .	1
437	Interview With the Assassin is structured less as a documentary and more as a found relic , and as such the film has a difficult time shaking its Blair Witch Project real-time roots .	1
438	It is most remarkable not because of its epic scope , but because of the startling intimacy it achieves despite that breadth .	4
439	A nearly 21\/2 hours , the film is way too indulgent .	1
440	Seems like something American and European gay movies were doing 20 years ago .	1
441	Claims to sort the bad guys from the good , which is its essential problem .	1
442	Mana gives us compelling , damaged characters who we want to help -- or hurt .	2
443	Good-looking but relentlessly lowbrow outing plays like Clueless Does South Fork .	1
444	Evokes a palpable sense of disconnection , made all the more poignant by the incessant use of cell phones .	3
445	The concept is a hoot .	3
446	A straight-shooting family film which awards animals the respect they 've rarely been given .	4
447	The directive to protect the code at all costs also begins to blur as the importance of the man and the code merge	2
448	What Eric Schaeffer has accomplished with Never Again may not , strictly speaking , qualify as revolutionary .	2
449	Obvious , obnoxious and didactic burlesque .	0
450	What can one say about a balding 50-year-old actor playing an innocent boy carved from a log ?	2
451	Ca n't seem to get anywhere near the story 's center .	2
452	Even with its $ 50-million US budget , Pinocchio never quite achieves the feel of a fanciful motion picture .	1
453	A little more intensity and a little less charm would have saved this film a world of hurt .	1
454	Like most of Jaglom 's films , some of it is honestly affecting , but more of it seems contrived and secondhand .	1
455	Maelstrom is a deliberately unsteady mixture of stylistic elements .	2
456	Just bring on the Battle Bots , please !	3
457	Sweet Home Alabama is n't going to win any Academy Awards , but this date-night diversion will definitely win some hearts .	3
458	Love may have been in the air onscreen , but I certainly was n't feeling any of it .	1
459	Too long , and larded with exposition , this somber cop drama ultimately feels as flat as the scruffy sands of its titular community .	1
460	The young stars are too cute ; the story and ensuing complications are too manipulative ; the message is too blatant ; the resolutions are too convenient .	1
461	In some ways , Lagaan is quintessential Bollywood .	2
462	A characteristically engorged and sloppy coming-of-age movie .	1
463	A wry , affectionate delight .	4
464	Credit director Ramsay for taking the sometimes improbable story and making it feel realistic .	3
465	The auteur 's ear for the way fears and slights are telegraphed in the most blithe exchanges gives the film its lingering tug .	3

467	Despite its lavish formalism and intellectual austerity , the film manages to keep you at the edge of your seat with its shape-shifting perils , political intrigue and brushes with calamity .	3
468	Friday After Next is the kind of film that could only be made by African-Americans because of its broad racial insensitivity towards African-Americans .	1
469	As lively an account as Seinfeld is deadpan .	1
470	Brings awareness to an issue often overlooked -- women 's depression .	2
471	Imagine a film that begins as a Seven rip-off , only to switch to a mix of The Shining , The Thing , and any naked teenagers horror flick from the 1980s .	1
472	Definitely funny stuff , but it 's more of the ` laughing at ' variety than the ` laughing with . '	3

480	Intelligent and moving .	4
481	This film is too busy hitting all of its assigned marks to take on any life of its own .	1
482	Mark Wahlberg ... may look classy in a '60s - homage pokepie hat , but as a character he 's dry , dry , dry .	2
483	The moral shrapnel and mental shellshock will linger long after this film has ended .	3
484	As Warren he stumbles in search of all the emotions and life experiences he 's neglected over the years .	2
485	It should have stayed there .	1

487	It is not the first time that director Sara Sugarman stoops to having characters drop their pants for laughs and not the last time she fails to provoke them .	0
488	There 's no point of view , no contemporary interpretation of Joan 's prefeminist plight , so we 're left thinking the only reason to make the movie is because present standards allow for plenty of nudity .	1
489	There is a strong directorial stamp on every frame of this stylish film that is able to visualize schizophrenia but is still confident enough to step back and look at the sick character with a sane eye .	3
490	Romantic , riveting and handsomely animated .	4
491	This overproduced piece of dreck is shockingly bad and absolutely unnecessary .	0
492	As saccharine as it is disposable .	1

494	A subtle , poignant picture of goodness that is flawed , compromised and sad .	2
495	An exceptionally acted , quietly affecting cop drama .	4
496	Even in the summertime , the most restless young audience deserves the dignity of an action hero motivated by something more than franchise possibilities .	1
497	Perfectly pitched between comedy and tragedy , hope and despair , About Schmidt instead comes far closer than many movies to expressing the way many of us live -- someplace between consuming self-absorption and insistently demanding otherness .	4
498	She nearly glows with enthusiasm , sensuality and a conniving wit .	3
499	Despite modest aspirations its occasional charms are not to be dismissed .	3
500	So exaggerated and broad that it comes off as annoying rather than charming .	1
501	Strange , funny , twisted , brilliant and macabre .	4
502	The film has the thrown-together feel of a summer-camp talent show : hastily written , underrehearsed , arbitrarily plotted and filled with crude humor and vulgar innuendo .	1
503	The cast comes through even when the movie does n't .	2
504	A rock-solid gangster movie with a fair amount of suspense , intriguing characters and bizarre bank robberies , plus a heavy dose of father-and-son dynamics .	3
505	It 's both degrading and strangely liberating to see people working so hard at leading lives of sexy intrigue , only to be revealed by the dispassionate Gantz brothers as ordinary , pasty lumpen .	3
506	Innocuous enough to make even Jean-Claude Van Damme look good .	2
507	But if the essence of magic is its make-believe promise of life that soars above the material realm , this is the opposite of a truly magical movie .	0
508	But its storytelling prowess and special effects are both listless .	1
509	I stopped thinking about how good it all was , and started doing nothing but reacting to it - feeling a part of its grand locations , thinking urgently as the protagonists struggled , feeling at the mercy of its inventiveness , gasping at its visual delights .	4
510	Newcomer helmer Kevin Donovan is hamstrung by a badly handled screenplay of what is really an amusing concept -- a high-tech tux that transforms its wearer into a superman .	2
511	One Hour Photo may seem disappointing in its generalities , but it 's the little nuances that perhaps had to escape from director Mark Romanek 's self-conscious scrutiny to happen , that finally get under your skin .	1
512	With a confrontational stance , Todd Solondz takes aim on political correctness and suburban families .	2
513	A processed comedy chop suey .	1
514	eventually arrives at its heart , as simple self-reflection meditation .	3
515	Proves a lovely trifle that , unfortunately , is a little too in love with its own cuteness .	1
516	So purely enjoyable that you might not even notice it 's a fairly straightforward remake of Hollywood comedies such as Father of the Bride .	3
517	An intelligent , multi-layered and profoundly humanist -LRB- not to mention gently political -RRB- meditation on the values of knowledge , education , and the affects of cultural and geographical displacement .	4
518	I 'm not sure which is worse : the poor acting by the ensemble cast , the flat dialogue by Vincent R. Nebrida or the gutless direction by Laurice Guillen .	0

525	-LRB- Raimi 's -RRB- matured quite a bit with Spider-Man , even though it 's one of the most plain white toast comic book films you 'll ever see .	2
526	It 's about as convincing as any other Arnie musclefest , but has a little too much resonance with real world events and ultimately comes off as insultingly simplistic .	1
527	An unbelievably stupid film , though occasionally fun enough to make you forget its absurdity .	1
528	In between the icy stunts , the actors spout hilarious dialogue about following your dream and ` just letting the mountain tell you what to do . '	3

536	Unambitious writing emerges in the movie , using a plot that could have come from an animated-movie screenwriting textbook .	1

550	A small gem of a movie that defies classification and is as thought-provoking as it is funny , scary and sad .	3
551	Somewhere in the middle , the film compels , as Demme experiments he harvests a few movie moment gems , but the field of roughage dominates .	2
552	While the story is better-focused than the incomprehensible Anne Rice novel it 's based upon , Queen Of The Damned is a pointless , meandering celebration of the goth-vampire , tortured woe-is-me lifestyle .	0

562	Will certainly appeal to Asian cult cinema fans and Asiaphiles interested to see what all the fuss is about .	3
563	Green ruins every single scene he 's in , and the film , while it 's not completely wreaked , is seriously compromised by that .	1
564	Evokes the frustration , the awkwardness and the euphoria of growing up , without relying on the usual tropes .	1
565	Standing in the Shadows of Motown is the best kind of documentary , one that makes a depleted yesterday feel very much like a brand-new tomorrow .	4
566	This is a very ambitious project for a fairly inexperienced filmmaker , but good actors , good poetry and good music help sustain it .	3

623	An hour and a half of joyful solo performance .	4
624	Like its parade of predecessors , this Halloween is a gory slash-fest .	3
625	Better than the tepid Star Trek : Insurrection ; falls short of First Contact because the villain could n't pick the lint off Borg Queen Alice Krige 's cape ; and finishes half a parsec -LRB- a nose -RRB- ahead of Generations .	2

627	It 's just rather leaden and dull .	0
628	Rice never clearly defines his characters or gives us a reason to care about them .	1

633	Its impressive images of crematorium chimney fires and stacks of dead bodies are undermined by the movie 's presentation , which is way too stagy .	1
634	Triple X is a double agent , and he 's one bad dude .	3
635	There has been a string of ensemble cast romances recently ... but Peter Mattei 's Love in the Time of Money sets itself apart by forming a chain of relationships that come full circle to end on a positive -LRB- if tragic -RRB- note .	3

639	The filmmakers ' eye for detail and the high standards of performance convey a strong sense of the girls ' environment .	3
640	It wraps up a classic mother\/daughter struggle in recycled paper with a shiny new bow and while the audience can tell it 's not all new , at least it looks pretty .	2

645	... a vivid , thoughtful , unapologetically raw coming-of-age tale full of sex , drugs and rock 'n' roll .	4
646	A bittersweet contemporary comedy about benevolent deception , which , while it may not rival the filmmaker 's period pieces , is still very much worth seeing .	4
647	Shankman ... and screenwriter Karen Janszen bungle their way through the narrative as if it were a series of Bible parables and not an actual story .	0
648	They can and will turn on a dime from oddly humorous to tediously sentimental .	3

652	All three actresses are simply dazzling , particularly Balk , who 's finally been given a part worthy of her considerable talents .	4
653	The beautiful , unusual music is this film 's chief draw , but its dreaminess may lull you to sleep .	2
654	You may be captivated , as I was , by its moods , and by its subtly transformed star , and still wonder why Paul Thomas Anderson ever had the inclination to make the most sincere and artful movie in which Adam Sandler will probably ever appear .	3
655	The only surprise is that heavyweights Joel Silver and Robert Zemeckis agreed to produce this ; I assume the director has pictures of them cavorting in ladies ' underwear .	1
656	Ver Wiel 's desperate attempt at wit is lost , leaving the character of Critical Jim two-dimensional and pointless .	1
657	So vivid a portrait of a woman consumed by lust and love and crushed by betrayal that it conjures up the intoxicating fumes and emotional ghosts of a freshly painted Rembrandt .	4
658	Cacoyannis ' vision is far less mature , interpreting the play as a call for pity and sympathy for anachronistic phantasms haunting the imagined glory of their own pasts .	1
659	In other words , it 's badder than bad .	0
660	Wedding feels a bit anachronistic .	0
661	Dong never pushes for insights beyond the superficial tensions of the dynamic he 's dissecting , and the film settles too easily along the contours of expectation .	1

665	You can see where Big Bad Love is trying to go , but it never quite gets there .	2
666	A sleek advert for youthful anomie that never quite equals the sum of its pretensions .	1
667	Statham employs an accent that I think is supposed to be an attempt at hardass American but sometimes just lapses into unhidden British .	1
668	If A Few Good Men told us that we `` ca n't handle the truth '' than High Crimes poetically states at one point in this movie that we `` do n't care about the truth . ''	2
669	So boring that even its target audience talked all the way through it .	0

680	The heart of the film is a touching reflection on aging , suffering and the prospect of death .	3
681	It 's a glorious spectacle like those D.W. Griffith made in the early days of silent film .	4
682	The movie is undone by a filmmaking methodology that 's just experimental enough to alienate the mainstream audience while ringing cliched to hardened indie-heads .	1
683	The year 's greatest adventure , and Jackson 's limited but enthusiastic adaptation has made literature literal without killing its soul -- a feat any thinking person is bound to appreciate .	4
684	If this movie leaves you cool , it also leaves you intriguingly contemplative .	2
685	When all is said and done , she loves them to pieces -- and so , I trust , will you .	3
686	It takes you somewhere you 're not likely to have seen before , but beneath the exotic surface -LRB- and exotic dancing -RRB- it 's surprisingly old-fashioned .	3
687	Director Claude Chabrol has become the master of innuendo .	3
688	Woven together handsomely , recalling sixties ' rockumentary milestones from Lonely Boy to Do n't Look Back .	3

699	Too bland and fustily tasteful to be truly prurient .	1
700	While Tattoo borrows heavily from both Seven and The Silence of the Lambs , it manages to maintain both a level of sophisticated intrigue and human-scale characters that suck the audience in .	4
701	Once he starts learning to compromise with reality enough to become comparatively sane and healthy , the film becomes predictably conventional .	1
702	The film is ... determined to treat its characters , weak and strong , as fallible human beings , not caricatures , and to carefully delineate the cost of the inevitable conflicts between human urges and an institution concerned with self-preservation .	3
703	Even as it pays earnest homage to turntablists and beat jugglers , old schoolers and current innovators , Scratch is great fun , full of the kind of energy it 's documenting .	3

705	Producer John Penotti surveyed high school students ... and came back with the astonishing revelation that `` they wanted to see something that did n't talk down to them . ''	3
706	A real winner -- smart , funny , subtle , and resonant .	4
707	Ultimate X is a ride , basically the kind of greatest-hits reel that might come with a subscription to ESPN the Magazine .	2
708	Unfortunately , contrived plotting , stereotyped characters and Woo 's over-the-top instincts as a director undermine the moral dilemma at the movie 's heart .	2
709	Jones ... makes a great impression as the writer-director of this little $ 1.8 million charmer , which may not be cutting-edge indie filmmaking but has a huge heart .	4

751	It 'll keep you wide awake and ... very tense .	3
752	The movie is loaded with good intentions , but in his zeal to squeeze the action and our emotions into the all-too-familiar dramatic arc of the Holocaust escape story , Minac drains his movie of all individuality .	1
753	It may scream low budget , but this charmer has a spirit that can not be denied .	3
754	Less an examination of neo-Nazism than a probe into the nature of faith itself .	3
755	Though few will argue that it ranks with the best of Herzog 's works , Invincible shows he 's back in form , with an astoundingly rich film .	4
756	While it may not add up to the sum of its parts , Holofcener 's film offers just enough insight to keep it from being simpleminded , and the ensemble cast is engaging enough to keep you from shifting in your chair too often .	3
757	There are no special effects , and no Hollywood endings .	3
758	Despite Juliet Stevenon 's attempt to bring cohesion to Pamela 's emotional roller coaster life , it is not enough to give the film the substance it so desperately needs .	1
759	Not a schlocky creature feature but something far more stylish and cerebral -- and , hence , more chillingly effective .	3
760	From a deceptively simple premise , this deeply moving French drama develops a startling story that works both as a detailed personal portrait and as a rather frightening examination of modern times .	4
761	The movie is obviously a labour of love so Howard appears to have had free rein to be as pretentious as he wanted .	2
762	A stylish cast and some clever scripting solutions help Chicago make the transition from stage to screen with considerable appeal intact .	3
763	Fessenden 's narrative is just as much about the ownership and redefinition of myth as it is about a domestic unit finding their way to joy .	3

963	Star\/producer Salma Hayek and director Julie Taymor have infused Frida with a visual style unique and inherent to the titular character 's paintings and in the process created a masterful work of art of their own .	3
964	This one is not nearly as dreadful as expected .	3
965	But ... in trying to capture the novel 's deeper intimate resonances , the film has -- ironically - distanced us from the characters .	1
966	Real Women Have Curves wears its empowerment on its sleeve but even its worst harangues are easy to swallow thanks to remarkable performances by Ferrera and Ontiveros .	3
967	There 's a whole heap of nothing at the core of this slight coming-of-age\/coming-out tale .	1
968	A sensitive , moving , brilliantly constructed work .	4

976	An EXIT sign , that is .	1
977	It 's an actor 's showcase that accomplishes its primary goal without the use of special effects , but rather by emphasizing the characters -- including the supporting ones .	2
978	The Emperor 's Club , ruthless in its own placid way , finds one of our most conservative and hidebound movie-making traditions and gives it new texture , new relevance , new reality .	4
979	... if it had been only half-an-hour long or a TV special , the humor would have been fast and furious -- at ninety minutes , it drags .	1

1018	-LRB- A -RRB- wonderfully loopy tale of love , longing , and voting .	4
1019	The characters , cast in impossibly contrived situations , are totally estranged from reality .	1
1020	For every cheesy scene , though , there is a really cool bit -- the movie 's conception of a future-world holographic librarian -LRB- Orlando Jones -RRB- who knows everything and answers all questions , is visually smart , cleverly written , and nicely realized .	3
1021	The mark of a respectable summer blockbuster is one of two things : unadulterated thrills or genuine laughs .	4
1022	As a hybrid teen thriller and murder mystery , Murder by Numbers fits the profile too closely .	2

1491	A sometimes incisive and sensitive portrait that is undercut by its awkward structure and a final veering toward melodrama .	1

1507	One of the best looking and stylish animated movies in quite a while ...	4

1527	While I ca n't say it 's on par with the first one , Stuart Little 2 is a light , fun cheese puff of a movie .	3
1528	And he allows a gawky actor like Spall -- who could too easily become comic relief in any other film -- to reveal his impressively delicate range .	3
1529	The Chateau belongs to Rudd , whose portrait of a therapy-dependent flakeball spouting French malapropisms ... is a nonstop hoot .	3

1539	The Way Home is an ode to unconditional love and compassion garnered from years of seeing it all , a condition only the old are privy to , and ... often misconstrued as weakness .	3
1540	An ugly , revolting movie .	1
1541	It never quite makes it to the boiling point , but manages to sustain a good simmer for most of its running time .	3
1542	Like Kissing Jessica Stein , Amy 's Orgasm has a key strength in its willingness to explore its principal characters with honesty , insight and humor .	3
1543	The main problem being that it 's only a peek .	2
1544	As predictable as the outcome of a Globetrotters-Generals game , Juwanna Mann is even more ludicrous than you 'd expect from the guy-in-a-dress genre , and a personal low for everyone involved .	0
1545	But it 's hard to imagine a more generic effort in the genre .	0
1546	Jason Patric and Ray Liotta make for one splendidly cast pair .	4
1547	This often-hilarious farce manages to generate the belly laughs of lowbrow comedy without sacrificing its high-minded appeal .	4

1552	Wait for pay per view or rental but do n't dismiss BarberShop out of hand .	2
1553	All very stylish and beautifully photographed , but far more trouble than it 's worth , with fantasy mixing with reality and actors playing more than one role just to add to the confusion .	2
1554	`` The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys '' has flaws , but it also has humor and heart and very talented young actors	3

1561	Cal is an unpleasantly shallow and immature character with whom to spend 110 claustrophobic minutes .	1
1562	It lacks the compassion , good-natured humor and the level of insight that made -LRB- Eyre 's -RRB- first film something of a sleeper success .	1
1563	And thanks to Kline 's superbly nuanced performance , that pondering is highly pleasurable .	4

1587	Its gentle , touching story creeps into your heart .	4
1588	... has about 3\/4th the fun of its spry 2001 predecessor -- but it 's a rushed , slapdash , sequel-for-the-sake - of-a-sequel with less than half the plot and ingenuity .	0
1589	Alain Choquart 's camera barely stops moving , portraying both the turmoil of the time and giving Conduct a perpetual sense of urgency , which , for a film that takes nearly three hours to unspool , is both funny and irritating .	2
1590	The kind of sense of humor that derives from a workman 's grasp of pun and entendre and its attendant need to constantly draw attention to itself .	2

1599	You may feel compelled to watch the film twice or pick up a book on the subject .	3
1600	Loosely speaking , we 're in All of Me territory again , and , strictly speaking , Schneider is no Steve Martin .	0
1601	On a certain base level , Blue Crush delivers what it promises , just not well enough to recommend it .	2
1602	Gussied up with so many distracting special effects and visual party tricks that it 's not clear whether we 're supposed to shriek or laugh .	1
1603	The screenplay , co-written by director Imogen Kimmel , lacks the wit necessary to fully exploit the comic elements of the premise , making the proceedings more bizarre than actually amusing .	1
1604	That 's because relatively nothing happens .	1
1605	` Snow Dogs ' has both .	2
1606	A decent-enough nail-biter that stands a good chance of being the big hit Franklin needs to stay afloat in Hollywood .	3
1607	The movie is concocted and carried out by folks worthy of scorn , and the nicest thing I can say is that I ca n't remember a single name responsible for it .	0
1608	The impulses that produced this project ... are commendable , but the results are uneven .	2
1609	Watching Harris ham it up while physically and emotionally disintegrating over the course of the movie has a certain poignancy in light of his recent death , but Boyd 's film offers little else of consequence .	2
1610	As quiet , patient and tenacious as Mr. Lopez himself , who approaches his difficult , endless work with remarkable serenity and discipline .	4
1611	Hugely entertaining from start to finish , featuring a fall from grace that still leaves shockwaves , it will gratify anyone who has ever suspected Hollywood of being overrun by corrupt and hedonistic weasels .	4
1612	Squandering his opportunity to make absurdist observations , Burns gets caught up in the rush of slapstick thoroughfare .	1
1613	Topics that could make a sailor blush - but lots of laughs .	4
1614	It 's so laddish and juvenile , only teenage boys could possibly find it funny .	2
1615	One of those movies that make us pause and think of what we have given up to acquire the fast-paced contemporary society .	3
1616	A loud , brash and mainly unfunny high school comedy .	0
1617	... one of the most entertaining monster movies in ages ...	4
1618	The movie 's something-borrowed construction feels less the product of loving , well integrated homage and more like a mere excuse for the wan , thinly sketched story .	1
1619	With tiny little jokes and nary an original idea , this sappy ethnic sleeper proves that not only blockbusters pollute the summer movie pool .	1
1620	The movie keeps coming back to the achingly unfunny Phonce and his several silly subplots .	1
1621	... a mostly boring affair with a confusing sudden finale that 's likely to irk viewers .	2
1622	A reality-snubbing hodgepodge .	1

1624	The humor and humanity of Monsoon Wedding are in perfect balance .	3
1625	There are things to like about Murder By Numbers -- but , in the end , the disparate elements do n't gel .	2
1626	Quaid is utterly fearless as the tortured husband living a painful lie , and Moore wonderfully underplays the long-suffering heroine with an unflappable '50s dignity somewhere between Jane Wyman and June Cleaver .	3
1627	What begins as a film in the tradition of The Graduate quickly switches into something more recyclable than significant .	2
1628	Apparently reassembled from the cutting-room floor of any given daytime soap .	1
1629	A brisk , reverent , and subtly different sequel .	4
1630	The story , once it gets rolling , is nothing short of a great one .	4
1631	It 's not the worst comedy of the year , but it certainly wo n't win any honors .	2
1632	Some people want the ol' ball-and-chain and then there are those who just want the Ball and Chain .	2
1633	One of the funnier movies in town .	4
1634	The universal theme of becoming a better person through love has never been filmed more irresistibly than in ` Baran . '	4
1635	American and European cinema has amassed a vast Holocaust literature , but it is impossible to think of any film more challenging or depressing than The Grey Zone .	1
1636	An elegant film	2
1637	An example of quiet , confident craftsmanship that tells a sweet , charming tale of intergalactic friendship .	4
1638	A plodding teen remake that 's so mechanical you can smell the grease on the plot twists .	0
1639	A stylistic romp that 's always fun to watch .	4
1640	Like its title character , this Nicholas Nickleby finds itself in reduced circumstances -- and , also like its hero , it remains brightly optimistic , coming through in the end .	3
1641	Although mainstream American movies tend to exploit the familiar , every once in a while a film arrives from the margin that gives viewers a chance to learn , to grow , to travel .	3
1642	Film ca n't quite maintain its initial momentum , but remains sporadically funny throughout .	2
1643	It seems impossible that an epic four-hour Indian musical about a cricket game could be this good , but it is .	3
1644	A zinger-filled crowd-pleaser that open-minded Elvis fans -LRB- but by no means all -RRB- will have fun with .	4
1645	Kicks off with an inauspicious premise , mopes through a dreary tract of virtually plotless meanderings and then ends with a whimper .	1
1646	Most of the problems with the film do n't derive from the screenplay , but rather the mediocre performances by most of the actors involved	0
1647	There 's no conversion effort , much of the writing is genuinely witty and both stars are appealing enough to probably have a good shot at a Hollywood career , if they want one .	3
1648	The movie turns out to be -LRB- Assayas ' -RRB- homage to the Gallic ` tradition of quality , ' in all its fusty squareness .	1
1649	Mattei so completely loses himself to the film 's circular structure to ever offer any insightful discourse on , well , Love in the Time of Money .	1
1650	Returning director Rob Minkoff ... and screenwriter Bruce Joel Rubin ... have done a fine job of updating White 's dry wit to a new age .	4
1651	The film has a laundry list of minor shortcomings , but the numerous scenes of gory mayhem are worth the price of admission ... if `` gory mayhem '' is your idea of a good time .	3
1652	That is because - damn it !	2
1653	It would be great to see this turd squashed under a truck , preferably a semi .	0
1654	What a vast enterprise has been marshaled in the service of such a minute idea .	2
1655	This may be Burns 's strongest film since The Brothers McMullen .	4
1656	No better or worse than ` Truth or Consequences , N.M. ' or any other interchangeable actioner with imbecilic Mafia toolbags botching a routine assignment in a Western backwater .	1
1657	Deliciously mean-spirited and wryly observant .	3
1658	When twentysomething hotsies make movies about their lives , hard-driving narcissism is a given , but what a world we 'd live in if Argento 's Hollywood counterparts ... had this much imagination and nerve .	3
1659	But it 's worth the concentration .	3
1660	Despite its promising cast of characters , Big Trouble remains a loosely tied series of vignettes which only prove that ` zany ' does n't necessarily mean ` funny . '	1
1661	But the second half of the movie really goes downhill .	0
1662	It is supremely unfunny and unentertaining to watch middle-age and older men drink to excess , piss on trees , b.s. one another and put on a show in drag .	0
1663	The big finish is a bit like getting all excited about a chocolate eclair and then biting into it and finding the filling missing .	1
1664	A good music documentary , probably one of the best since The Last Waltz .	4
1665	It is a movie about passion .	2
1666	Certainly .	2
1667	But what 's nice is that there 's a casual intelligence that permeates the script .	4
1668	Lush and beautifully photographed -LRB- somebody suggested the stills might make a nice coffee table book -RRB- , but ultimately you 'll leave the theater wondering why these people mattered .	1
1669	... another example of how Sandler is losing his touch .	1
1670	This is an undeniably intriguing film from an adventurous young talent who finds his inspiration on the fringes of the American underground .	4
1671	A fleet-footed and pleasingly upbeat family diversion .	3
1672	Efficient , suitably anonymous chiller .	3
1673	This follow-up seems so similar to the 1953 Disney classic that it makes one long for a geriatric Peter .	2
1674	The movie 's plot is almost entirely witless and inane , carrying every gag two or three times beyond its limit to sustain a laugh .	0
1675	This movie is so bad , that it 's almost worth seeing because it 's so bad .	1
1676	Gently humorous and touching .	3
1677	At its worst , the movie is pretty diverting ; the pity is that it rarely achieves its best .	2
1678	It cuts to the core of what it actually means to face your fears , to be a girl in a world of boys , to be a boy truly in love with a girl , and to ride the big metaphorical wave that is life -- wherever it takes you .	4
1679	Spider-Man is in the same category as X-Men - occasionally brilliant but mostly average , showing signs of potential for the sequels , but not giving us much this time around .	2
1680	When the twist endings were actually surprising ?	2
1681	Much of the cast is stiff or just plain bad .	1
1682	The last three narcissists left on earth compete for each others ' affections .	2
1683	Represents a worthy departure from the culture clash comedies that have marked an emerging Indian American cinema .	3
1684	A compelling film .	4
1685	The movie is well done , but slow .	1
1686	It is up to you to decide if you need to see it .	2
1687	Yet in its own aloof , unreachable way it 's so fascinating you wo n't be able to look away for a second .	3
1688	`` Bad '' is the operative word for `` Bad Company , '' and I do n't mean that in a good way .	0
1689	I 'm not a fan of the phrase ` life affirming ' because it usually means ` schmaltzy , ' but Real Women Have Curves truly is life affirming .	3
1690	No one can doubt the filmmakers ' motives , but The Guys still feels counterproductive .	1
1691	Offers a clear-eyed chronicle of a female friendship that is more complex and honest than anything represented in a Hollywood film .	4
1692	The worst film of the year .	0
1693	` Christian Bale 's Quinn -LRB- is -RRB- a leather clad grunge-pirate with a hairdo like Gandalf in a wind-tunnel and a simply astounding cor-blimey-luv-a-duck cockney accent . '	1
1694	The only thing scary about feardotcom is that the filmmakers and studio are brazen enough to attempt to pass this stinker off as a scary movie .	0
1695	Throwing it all away for the fleeting joys of love 's brief moment .	2
1696	Take away the controversy , and it 's not much more watchable than a Mexican soap opera .	0
1697	A raunchy and frequently hilarious follow-up to the gifted Korean American stand-up 's I 'm the One That I Want .	3
1698	Painful , horrifying and oppressively tragic , this film should not be missed .	4
1699	The most brilliant and brutal UK crime film since Jack Carter went back to Newcastle , the first half of Gangster No. 1 drips with style and , at times , blood .	4
1700	Yes , I suppose it 's lovely that Cal works out his issues with his dad and comes to terms with his picture-perfect life -- but World Traveler gave me no reason to care , so I did n't .	0
1701	Broomfield is energized by Volletta Wallace 's maternal fury , her fearlessness , and because of that , his film crackles .	4
1702	Yet the act is still charming here .	3
1703	The plot 's contrivances are uncomfortably strained .	1
1704	It has that rare quality of being able to creep the living hell out of you ...	4
1705	He drags it back , single-handed .	3
1706	It may not be `` Last Tango in Paris '' but ...	2
1707	A `` Home Alone '' film that is staged like `` Rosemary 's Baby , '' but is not as well-conceived as either of those films .	1
1708	A rather average action film that benefits from several funny moments supplied by Epps .	2
1709	of whimsicality , narrative discipline and serious improvisation	3
1710	Often hilarious .	3
1711	I 'm convinced I could keep a family of five blind , crippled , Amish people alive in this situation better than these British soldiers do at keeping themselves kicking .	1
1712	An elegant work , Food of Love is as consistently engaging as it is revealing .	3
1713	The jokes are telegraphed so far in advance they must have been lost in the mail .	1
1714	Give Shapiro , Goldman , and Bolado credit for good intentions , but there 's nothing here that they could n't have done in half an hour .	1
1715	... this is n't even a movie we can enjoy as mild escapism ; it is one in which fear and frustration are provoked to intolerable levels .	0
1716	It 's good , hard-edged stuff , violent and a bit exploitative but also nicely done , morally alert and street-smart .	3
1717	I like it .	3
1718	On its own , Big Trouble could be considered a funny little film .	3
1719	It 's not nearly as fresh or enjoyable as its predecessor , but there are enough high points to keep this from being a complete waste of time .	3
1720	This tale has been told and retold ; the races and rackets change , but the song remains the same .	1
1721	Worthless , from its pseudo-rock-video opening to the idiocy of its last frames .	0
1722	Makes a joke out of car chases for an hour and then gives us half an hour of car chases .	0
1723	A knowing sense of humor and a lot of warmth ignite Son of the Bride .	4
1724	Though there are entertaining and audacious moments , the movie 's wildly careening tone and an extremely flat lead performance do little to salvage this filmmaker 's flailing reputation .	1
1725	The Son Of The Bride 's humour is born out of an engaging storyline , which also is n't embarrassed to make you reach for the tissues .	4
1726	Even if the Naipaul original remains the real masterpiece , the movie possesses its own languorous charm .	4
1727	Ambitious , unsettling psychodrama that takes full , chilling advantage of its rough-around-the-edges , low-budget constraints .	3
1728	Most of the things that made the original Men in Black such a pleasure are still there .	3
1729	At times a bit melodramatic and even a little dated -LRB- depending upon where you live -RRB- , Ignorant Fairies is still quite good-natured and not a bad way to spend an hour or two .	3
1730	Or for the year , for that matter .	2
1731	I had more fun watching Spy than I had with most of the big summer movies .	4
1732	It 's just merely very bad .	0
1733	the shackles	2
1734	Watching this gentle , mesmerizing portrait of a man coming to terms with time , you barely realize your mind is being blown .	3
1735	You can watch , giggle and get an adrenaline boost without feeling like you 've completely lowered your entertainment standards .	3
1736	Some movies blend together as they become distant memories .	2
1737	Nair just does n't have the necessary self-control to guide a loose , poorly structured film through the pitfalls of incoherence and redundancy .	0
1738	Chouraqui brings documentary-like credibility to the horrors of the killing field and the barbarism of ` ethnic cleansing . '	3
1739	Woody Allen used to ridicule movies like Hollywood Ending .	1
1740	It 's mildly amusing , but I certainly ca n't recommend it .	1
1741	And it 's not that funny -- which is just generally insulting .	0
1742	As David Letterman and The Onion have proven , the worst of tragedies can be fertile sources of humor , but Lawrence has only a fleeting grasp of how to develop them .	0
1743	They just have problems , which are neither original nor are presented in convincing way .	1
1744	For all the dolorous trim , Secretary is a genial romance that maintains a surprisingly buoyant tone throughout , notwithstanding some of the writers ' sporadic dips into pop Freudianism .	3
1745	Like the original , this version is raised a few notches above kiddie fantasy pablum by Allen 's astringent wit .	3
1746	A taut , sobering film .	4
1747	Far-fetched premise , convoluted plot , and thematic mumbo jumbo about destiny and redemptive love .	2
1748	A muddle splashed with bloody beauty as vivid as any Scorsese has ever given us .	3
1749	The way the roundelay of partners functions , and the interplay within partnerships and among partnerships and the general air of Gator-bashing are consistently delightful .	4
1750	But while the highly predictable narrative falls short , Treasure Planet is truly gorgeous to behold .	4
1751	Directed with purpose and finesse by England 's Roger Mitchell , who handily makes the move from pleasing , relatively lightweight commercial fare such as Notting Hill to commercial fare with real thematic heft .	4
1752	One of these days Hollywood will come up with an original idea for a teen movie , but until then there 's always these rehashes to feed to the younger generations .	1
1753	A wild ride juiced with enough energy and excitement for at least three films .	3
1754	Nemesis suffers from a paunchy midsection , several plodding action sequences and a wickedly undramatic central theme .	1
1755	Lucky Break is perfectly inoffensive and harmless , but it 's also drab and inert .	2
1756	Elvira fans could hardly ask for more .	4
1757	Exactly what you 'd expect from a guy named Kaos .	2
1758	Like all great films about a life you never knew existed , it offers much to absorb and even more to think about after the final frame .	4
1759	It 's pretentious in a way that verges on the amateurish .	0
1760	... unlike -LRB- Scorsese 's Mean Streets -RRB- , Ash Wednesday is essentially devoid of interesting characters or even a halfway intriguing plot .	0
1761	Only two-fifths of a satisfying movie experience .	2
1762	... the good and different idea -LRB- of middle-aged romance -RRB- is not handled well and , except for the fine star performances , there is little else to recommend `` Never Again . ''	1
1763	Murder by Numbers ' is n't a great movie , but it 's a perfectly acceptable widget .	2
1764	It may as well be called `` Jar-Jar Binks : The Movie . ''	0
1765	But it would be better to wait for the video .	1
1766	Delirious fun .	4
1767	There are some fairly unsettling scenes , but they never succeed in really rattling the viewer .	1
1768	Special P.O.V. camera mounts on bikes , skateboards , and motorcycles provide an intense experience when splashed across the immense IMAX screen .	4
1769	There are scenes of cinematic perfection that steal your heart away .	4
1770	A fantastic premise anchors this movie , but what it needs is either a more rigid , Blair Witch-style commitment to its mockumentary format , or a more straightforward , dramatic treatment , with all the grandiosity that that implies .	2
1771	`` Interview '' loses its overall sense of mystery and becomes a TV episode rather than a documentary that you actually buy into .	0
1772	... the first 2\/3 of the film are incredibly captivating and insanely funny , thanks in part to interesting cinematic devices -LRB- cool visual backmasking -RRB- , a solid cast , and some wickedly sick and twisted humor ...	4

1888	Star Trek was kind of terrific once , but now it is a copy of a copy of a copy .	1
1889	Ms. Phoenix is completely lacking in charm and charisma , and is unable to project either Esther 's initial anomie or her eventual awakening .	0

1914	It was a dark and stormy night ...	2

1918	Rarely does such high-profile talent serve such literate material .	3

1926	It 's not hateful .	2
1927	The delicious trimmings ... arrive early and stay late , filling nearly every minute ... with a lighthearted glow , some impudent snickers , and a glorious dose of humankind 's liberating ability to triumph over a Scrooge or two .	4
1928	Needs more impressionistic cinematography and exhilarating point-of-view shots and fewer slow-motion ` grandeur ' shots and quick-cut edits that often detract from the athleticism .	1
1929	With a large cast representing a broad cross-section , Tavernier 's film bounds along with the rat-a-tat energy of `` His Girl Friday , '' maintaining a light touch while tackling serious themes .	3
1930	One of the most gloriously unsubtle and adrenalized extreme shockers since The Evil Dead .	3
1931	Lisa Rinzler 's cinematography may be lovely , but Love Liza 's tale itself virtually collapses into an inhalant blackout , maintaining consciousness just long enough to achieve callow pretension .	1
1932	It 's provocative stuff , but the speculative effort is hampered by Taylor 's cartoonish performance and the film 's ill-considered notion that Hitler 's destiny was shaped by the most random of chances .	1

2054	The art direction and costumes are gorgeous and finely detailed , and Kurys ' direction is clever and insightful .	4

2073	Gorgeous scenes , masterful performances , but the sickly sweet gender normative narrative left an acrid test in this gourmet 's mouth .	2
2074	Stuffed to the brim with ideas , American instigator Michael Moore 's film is a rambling examination of American gun culture that uses his usual modus operandi of crucifixion through juxtaposition .	3
2075	At its best , it 's Black Hawk Down with more heart .	3
2076	Although Barbershop boasts some of today 's hottest and hippest acts from the world of television , music and stand-up comedy , this movie strangely enough has the outdated swagger of a shameless ` 70s blaxploitation shuck-and-jive sitcom .	2

2087	It understands , in a way that speaks forcefully enough about the mechanisms of poverty to transcend the rather simplistic filmmaking .	2

2153	Just about all of the film is confusing on one level or another , making Ararat far more demanding than it needs to be .	1
2154	Daily struggles and simple pleasures usurp the preaching message so that , by the time the credits roll across the pat ending , a warm , fuzzy feeling prevails .	4
2155	Hatosy ... portrays young Brendan with his usual intelligence and subtlety , not to mention a convincing brogue .	3
2156	A uniquely sensual metaphorical dramatization of sexual obsession that spends a bit too much time on its fairly ludicrous plot .	3

2165	For all the time we spend with these people , we never really get inside of them .	1
2166	Eisenstein lacks considerable brio for a film about one of cinema 's directorial giants .	1

2173	Sly , sophisticated and surprising .	3
2174	All the pieces fall together without much surprise , but little moments give it a boost .	3
2175	Aimed squarely at the least demanding of demographic groups : very small children who will be delighted simply to spend more time with familiar cartoon characters .	2
2176	Like coming into a long-running , well-written television series where you 've missed the first half-dozen episodes and probably wo n't see the next six .	1

2190	Meyjes ... has done his homework and soaked up some jazzy new revisionist theories about the origins of Nazi politics and aesthetics .	3

2204	To honestly address the flaws inherent in how medical aid is made available to American workers , a more balanced or fair portrayal of both sides will be needed .	1
2205	A charming , banter-filled comedy ... one of those airy cinematic bon bons whose aims -- and by extension , accomplishments -- seem deceptively slight on the surface .	3
2206	A delightful little film that revels in its own simplicity , Mostly Martha will leave you with a smile on your face and a grumble in your stomach .	3

2213	Reggio and Glass put on an intoxicating show .	3
2214	likeable thanks to its cast , its cuisine and its quirky tunes .	4
2215	What with all the blanket statements and dime-store ruminations on vanity , the worries of the rich and sudden wisdom , the film becomes a sermon for most of its running time .	1
